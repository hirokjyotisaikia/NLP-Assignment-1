# Q. In some languages every statement ends with a semi-colon, ; What happens if you put a semi-colon at the end of a Python statement?
apple = 'it is a fruit';
print(apple)

#in python adding a semi-colon after a statement is not necessary as it is optional and it will execute the program without any errors

#output : it is a fruit
