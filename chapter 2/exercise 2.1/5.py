# Q.  In math notation you can multiply x and y like this: xy. What happens if you try that in Python?
x = 5
y = 5

print(xy) #invalid syntax
print(x*y)

#python allows us to multiply x and y using * operator i between them.
#xy is not a valid syntax to multiply and it is not allowed in python which will rise a syntaxError
